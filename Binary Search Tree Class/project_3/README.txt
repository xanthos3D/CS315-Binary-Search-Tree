with exception to the template provided by Ali Kooshesh all of the
code written in my solutions.hpp and solutions.cpp was only written by me.
any function from the lab were written by me and matthew but any implementation of project three was only done by me.

i have not provided any code to any other student. i have discussed different ways of implementation with other students.
i have talked to mark ian, america, and teo about some possible ways of solving these problems but they where more just hints than anything else.
as well as the conversations that took place during this weeks lab.

everything in my code works as intended passing all tests on blue.
